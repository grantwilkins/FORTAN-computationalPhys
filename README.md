# FORTAN-computationalPhys
This repository is a collection of .f95 files surrounding some computational situations that display a variety of differential equation approximation methods.

For use each file can stand alone. In larger projects that will come in the future there might be larger implementations that require
a separate set of instructions; until then each file contains a sufficient set of instructions.

A decent physical understanding should be required to run these, at least through a first undergraduate course in physics
to be able to successfully implement the calculations. 

Please reach out with any questions or suggestions for an improvement.
